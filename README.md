# Decentralized Voting System

## Project Description
The Decentralized Voting System is a transparent and secure election platform built on blockchain technology. It ensures a fair voting process where voters can participate directly, and results can be verified by anyone.

## Key Features
- âœ… Only the contract owner can start and stop voting.
- âœ… Prevents double voting using voter address tracking.
- âœ… Real-time access to vote counts per candidate.
- âœ… Secure and transparent smart contract-based election logic.
- âœ… Supports dynamic candidate initialization during deployment.

## Future Scope
- ðŸ”§ Integration with identity verification (KYC) to restrict eligible voters.
- ðŸ”§ Adding time-bound voting functionality.
- ðŸ”§ Incorporating on-chain result publication.
- ðŸ”§ Building a frontend DApp for easier voter interaction.
